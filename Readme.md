# Cartpole system playground

This repo contains a simulation of a cartpole system with various control engineering stuff. It's meant to refresh a few concepts and test capabilities of Julia.

## Simple simulation from initial conditions

## Estimations

Estimation of all 4 states from a single measurement of position `x`.

## LQR control

## Swing-up maneuver

### Using nonlinear optimization
